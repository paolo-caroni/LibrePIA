# LibrePIA
This is an attempt to create a LIBrary to Read and Edit PIA plot files (.pc3, .pmp, .stb, .ctb).
I have start to write this project because at the moment the support of ctb, stb, pmp and pc3 on free software is incomplete or simply not existent.
Honestly I'm not a programmer, so probably this library can be a good proof of concept, but without the help of other people I doubt it can be used for serious CAD project.
However I'm very motivated, since I want to print at least a correct PDF on my O.S. with free software only.
