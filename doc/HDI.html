<h1>HDI (Heidi® Device Interface)</h1>
<p>
HDI (Heidi® Device Interface) drivers are used to communicate with hard copy devices.<br>
<br>
WARNING: HDI (Heidi® Device Interface) it's totally different to Heidi that stands for HDI, which also stands for HOOPS Device Interface a software API developed by Ithaca Software for video card graphics driver.<br>
The similarity of Heidi and HDI name makes much confusion.<br>
<br>
Heidi® Device Interface it's proprietary and totally undocumented.<br>
I don't know if it's possible to replace it with Line Printer Remote protocol (LPD) or maybe Internet Printing Protocol(IPP).<br>
<br>
HDI drivers fall into three categories:<br>
<br>
-HDI File format drivers<br>
-HDI nonsystem drivers<br>
-HDI system printer drivers<br>
<br>
HDI File format drivers are virtual printer can print in .pdf or other file formats without any device.<br>
HDI nonsystem drivers should be used for older 'legacy' devices that cannot be set up through the operating system (OS).<br>
Newer devices that can be configured through the OS should be used by the program as a system printer instead of a nonsystem printer.<br>
