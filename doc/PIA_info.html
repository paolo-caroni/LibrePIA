<h1>Info</h1>
<b>I write this documentation because at the moment there isn't an "official" reference by Autodesk Inc. and probably will never be released.<br>
I hope this work can help who wants to understand how to read and write a .ctb, .stb, .pc3 or .pmp file.<br>
However this may not be a complete reference, simply because partial info was found on the web, other desumed reading free code not well documented.<br>
Autodesk has released the latest reference of DXF files under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA) 3.0, I hope that will do the same for PIA file and for .hdi (Heidi® Device Interface).<br>
<br>
I can make mistakes, if you see this or you have questions please <a href="mailto:kenren89@gmail.com">contact me</a>.<br>

The author of this documentation is Paolo Caroni (me), but much information was found on web.<br>
