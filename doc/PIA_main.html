<b>I have start to write this project because at the moment the support of ctb, stb, pmp and pc3 on free software is incomplete or simply not existent.<br>
Honestly I'm not a programmer, so probably this library can be a good proof of concept, but without the help of other people I doubt it can be used for serious CAD project.<br>
However I'm very motivated, since I want to print at least a correct PDF on my O.S. with free software only.<br>
<br>
The author of this project is Paolo Caroni (me), but any help would be very well accepted.<br>
