Done:
-write initial specification of PIA file (doc/index.html);
-read header;
-decompress data;
-plot_style parser;
-plot_style writer;
-write header and compress data all in one function called write_PIA (compatible);
-function for create new stb with deafult values;
-function for create new ctb with deafult values;
-function for add new plot_style on a stb;
-function for remove a specific plot_style on a stb;
-removed main to LibrePIA.c and create multiple example progam compiled with makefile;
-adler32 checksum verification on decompress_data function;
-ACI list;
-function for split and unsplit color;

ToDo (difficulty is from my point of view):

-add basic program for modify plot_style data with program and not with editor (medium);
-improve and test function for modify color (medium);
-add doxygen or other documentation (difficult);
-correct bug on stb with more plot_style number... study malloc (it's really important?)(very difficult);
-improve and verify writing compressed PIA file (difficult);
-add a gtk program for modify plot_style (maybe can be a different project, very difficult/near to impossible).
